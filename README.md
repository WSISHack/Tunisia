Welcome to PurifyIT. 

“Air pollution is increasing exponentially and serves as a major contributing factor to a wide-variety of global health issues.”
PurifyIT gathers air pollution data using sensors and feeds it into an algorithm that provides relevant information for government 
and citizens to incite healthy practices.  Citizens participate in change by installing sensors at their homes to provide more accurate
data.  This allows them to draw benefits in return.

For a citizen, he/she can check the co2 emission rate and other statistics per region/country through "citizen-dashboard.html". The access 
is limited for the citizen comparing it to the government.
For the government, all the datas collected via the sensors installed in different locations will be analyzed and gathered in a database, 
which feeds our application, showing a complete dashboard made of charts and graphics. This data will be used in order to take measures
that can be suggested by our team to tackle the air pollution problems. All this can be done via "index.html".


You can find the database tables neeeded for this application in "pollutiondb.sql".
